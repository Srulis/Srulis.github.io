        <h1>Project Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Have you ever had to fill out the same thing again and again on a website like <em>Salesforce</em>, only to have to change one field each time? Where <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en" target="_blank">Chrome Auto fill</a> just isn't enough?</p>
          <div class="notepaper">
            <figure class="quote">
              <blockquote class="curly-quotes" >
                I wish there was a simple AI Tool to create micro-automation for my basic work tasks.
              </blockquote>
              <figcaption class="quote-by">- Everyone</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
        <p>
          Then <strong>Chrome-Automation</strong> is a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions" target="_blank">Chrome Extension</a> tool for you! You set <em>record</em> on a website to begin to "learn" what things you do/don't do, then over a short period an automated script will be generated by the chrome extension. Think of them as your own personalised Chrome Extentions. You will be able to turn them <em>on/off</em> as desired and share the scripts with colleagues! 
        </p>
        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>
          My motivation to create Chrome-Automation is simple; I hate laborious repetitive tasks. I currently use a tool called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a> to allow me to create simple, to very complicated JavaScript snippets to automate part of my work. Creating these scripts does take some time, and the Chrome-Automation would be focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a> to automate this part of the task, which can involve a lot of effort. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I often want to share these scripts with others, and want others to have the benefit of these simple types of micro-automation without the need be proficient in CSS/JS/HTML. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that an array of small micro-automation tools will have an overall and holistic positive impact on a user's efficiency, accuracy and sanity.
        </p>
        <h1>Project Description</h1>
        <h4>Tool Overview </h4>
        <p>
          The tool would feature as a <strong>Chrome Extension</strong>. Users install the chrome extension then "Record" what they would like to automate. Using Machine Learning, over several attempts at a user competing an action Chrome-Automation would generate a script to automate that task. 
        </p>
        <h4>Features</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Learning</strong><br>
          Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.<br>
          Using this technology, the tool will create a set of scripts to automate basic daily tasks within your websites or web-apps. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Multi-Website Functionality</strong><br>
          As the extension is localised to a single machine then we can bypass some of the Internet browser rules around cross page scripting to allow a plethora of new possibilities.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Storing information to be used later, or on another website</li>
          <li>Pull information from one website to another </li>
          <li>Share information from your current website/web-apps and use APIs or Web-forms to trigger events without switching to the chrome tab, or even opening the website!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Re-arrange a website/web-app in <em>Editor mode</em></strong><br>
          If you like a button, link, or other object in a different place, or it impacts the work flow, then you will be able to move the object to a new desired location using “Drag-and-Drop" 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enterprise services</strong><br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Auto-deploy scripts on employees managed computers</li>
          <li>Use the bulk “learning” of all people in the organisation to generate the automated scripts faster </li>
          <li>Ability to create an Enterprise Library so that only those within the organisation can access the scripts </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Library of existing scripts</strong><br>
          A Cloud-based library of existing scripts created by others of the community that allow users import, and share resources online. This will also autorise cloud storage and auto-updates of subscribed scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Community space </strong><br>
          A space where Community members can contribute, comment, start discussions and ask questions and, create new ideas.<br>
          Ideas - A space where all clients can suggest changes to the service which can be voted upon by the community to dedicate development resources.
        </p>
        <h4>Service</h4>
        <p>
          As a means to generate income from this service I would suggest the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium" target="_blank">Freemium</a>  SaaS model. There would be several tiers of this service from Enterprise to induvial use. An example of the types of Tiered service would be; 
        </p>

        <li>Ability to share and enable scripts across the organisation</li>
        <li>Unlimited Library Access</li>
        <li>Ability to vote on community ideas or submit new ones, as an organisation or individually</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Ability to vote on community ideas and submit new ones</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tier 3 - Free
        <ul>
        <li>A limited number of stored scripts</li>
        <li>A limited number of synced library items</li>
        <li>Can comment on existing ideas, limited votes, but cannot create new ideas</li>
