        <h1>Myers-Briggs test</h1>
        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>
          You want close, supportive connections with others, and believe that cooperation is the best way to get things done. You like to be liked and are very sensitive to feedback, both positive and negative. You expect the best not just from yourself, but from others as well, and may find yourself disappointed when others are not as genuine in their intentions as you are. You work hard to maintain strong relationships, and strive to be a valuable member of your family and community.<br>You are typically energetic and driven, and often have a lot on your plate. You are tuned into the needs of others and acutely aware of human suffering; however, you also tend to be optimistic and forward-thinking, intuitively seeing opportunity for improvement. You are ambitious, but your ambition is not self-serving: rather, you feel personally responsible for making the world a better place.<br>Ref: <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/10858/test-results/7974722">https://www.truity.com/personality-test/10858/test-results/7974722</a><br><a href="TypeFinder_Personality_Test_Truity.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Report</a>

        <p>
          You are a Visual learner!<br>If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.<br>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.<br>Ref: <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=8&T=6">http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=8&T=6</a><br><a href="Learning_Style_The Results.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Report</a>
